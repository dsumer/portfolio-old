Over the last years many different React component libraries where released. For example [Ant Design](https://ant.design), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/). They all battle-powered us with components we‘ve needed in day-to-day UI development, but none of them changed the way I develop as ChakraUI did.

Chakra brings awesome new paradigms on the plate and at the same time complement the skills you've built as a web developer in the last 10 years.

# CSS as you know it

Do you know CSS? Oh well, then you already know how to develop with ChakraUI. When you’re styling components you’re able to style them with props which map 1:1 to existing CSS properties as you know them.

example

As you’re applying those properties to your components, ChakraUI takes care of generating CSS classes containing those styles, so you don’t have to worry that they will just appended via the style attribute.

In addition ChakraUI gives you some abbreviations which map to CSS properties in order to increase readability. For example w maps to width, m maps to margin, pos maps to position and so on.

# Approachable CSS-in-JS

To be honest I never felt comfortable with existing CSS-in-JS solutions and always ended writing less files which held the styles for the corresponding components. Chakra changed this.

With it’s composable nature it’s a breeze to either just style single elements in your component, or just create a new component which extends the styles of another one. Your freedom is endless.
