I am writing React applications since almost 4 years. Since then a lot changed in the ecosystem and also very good paradigm changes arose in the React library itself. But my choice for handling state management didn’t change. I want to show you why this is the case and why I would choose MobX for almost every project.

# Only rerender affected components

This is one of my most beloved things about MobX.

The only thing which is up to you, is to slice your components in a manner that they don’t interfere with each others state. And this is a thing which you should do nevertheless, even if you’re not using MobX.

With this approach MobX creates performant web applications by purpose

# Better separation of concerns

# Reduce boilerplate code

# Harmony together with Hooks

# Maturity of MobX 6

With MobX 6 the library got even more mature. Decorators / Not

# In which cases I wouldn’t pull MobX into a project?

# Summary

To be honest, I may sound like `test` a little fanboy. But with all those benefits MobX is just my absolute first choice when creating React Applications.

```js
function test() {
  console.log('test');
}
```

```js:package.json
{
  "test": "abc"
}
```
